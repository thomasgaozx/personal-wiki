# Graph Theory

## Preliminaries Definitions

- **Self Loop**: an edge from a node to itself
- **Subgraph**: graph $G$ is a subgraph of $H$ if the nodes of $G$ are a subset of the nodes of $H$, and te edge of $G$ are the edges of $H$ on the corresponding nodes.
- **Path**: a sequence of nodes connected by edges.
- **Simple Path**: a path that doesn't repeat any nodes
- **Cycle**: a path that starts and ends in the same node
- **Connected Graph**: a graph is _connected_ if every two nodes have a path between them.

Both directed and undirected graph $G$ are often represented by $(V,E)$ where $V$ is a set of vertices and $E$ is a set of edges.
