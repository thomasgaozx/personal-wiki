# C++ Compilation Steps

## Preprocessor step

To stop after the preprocessor step, use -E option:

```sh
g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -E prog1.cpp
```

The C++ preprocessor copies the contents of the included header files into the source code file, generates macro code, and replaces symbolic constants defined using `#define` with their values. The expanded source code file will be printed on standard output.

## Compile Step

To stop after the compile step, use -S option:

```sh
g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -S prog1.cpp
```

The expanded source code file produced by the C++ preprocessor is compiled into the assembly language for the platform.
Only `.cpp` files will be compiled into `.s` files, not `.hpp` files.
Unresolved symbols are permitted at this stage, e.g. function or class declarations without definition.
`prog1.cpp` will become `prog1.s`

## Assembly Step

To stop after the assembly step, use -c options:

```sh
g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -c prog1.cpp
```

The assembler code generated by the compiler is assembled into the object code for the platform.
`prog1.cpp` will become `prog1.o`

## Linking Step

The object files are linked into one executable file to resolve all undefined symbols. 
Unresolved symbols are not permitted at this stage.
